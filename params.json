{"name":"Pi-weather","tagline":"python scripts weatherboard","body":"# pi-weather\r\nI had bought this Odroid-Weatherboard by a german distributor. The compact dimensions allows three sensors on one Board to attach all to a raspberry pi. The quick2wire-libraries i used, makes it possible to build code for weather-apps in python. During the python code works in the background, the pi can make collected weatherdata public over a web-server for an example. But first they have to be stored on local memory. For later outputting data and visualisation on a browser, i have to create some php-scripts.<br>\r\n(14 05 2015)<br>\r\nThe programming of these sensors on the weatherboard are complete. The next thing what i will do is to create a graphical interface for websites in php, a table output and some search routines.\r\nto be continued...<br>\r\n(10 06 2015)<br>\r\nAdded a python-script called lcdprint. You can send a message to a twi-interfaced YuroBot display 4x20.\r\nopen a ssh-shell and type: <font color=\"red\"><b><p style=\"font-color:red\">lcdprint linenumber(0-3) \"Hello Message\".</p></b></font> Use this python-file to display data from\r\nsensor devices, that are connected on the same i2c bus, where the LCD-Display is.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
