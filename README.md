# pi-weather
I had bought this Odroid-Weatherboard by a german distributor. The compact dimensions allows three sensors on one Board to attach all to a raspberry pi. The quick2wire-libraries i used, makes it possible to build code for weather-apps in python. During the python code works in the background, the pi can make collected weatherdata public over a web-server for an example. But first they have to be stored on local memory. For later outputting data and visualisation on a browser, i have to create some php-scripts.

The programming of these sensors on the weatherboard are complete. The next thing what i will do is to create a graphical interface for websites in php, a table output and some search routines.
to be continued...
