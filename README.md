# pi-weather
I had bought this Odroid-Weatherboard by an german distributor. The compact dimensions allows three sensors on one Board to attach. The quick2wire-libraries i used, makes it possible to build code in python. During the python code works in the background, the pi can make collected weatherdata public over a web-server for an example. But first they have to be stored on local memory. For later outputting data and visualisation on a browser, i will create php-scripts, when i have written my python routines.
